## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros".

**Basic Process**:
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer for 25 minutes (one pomodoro)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)

This technique helps maintain focus and avoid mental fatigue, making it easier to accomplish tasks and projects.
